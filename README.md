## Using this library in your project

You can install this project with one of these commands:

    npm install --save @mojitonft/mojito-mixers
    yarn add @mojitonft/mojito-mixers

Alternatively, once you've built the library using `yarn dist:build`, you can install it locally in another project adding
this line to your `package.json`'s dependencies. If you update it, make sure you remove the entry from `yarn.lock` and
re-install it.

    "@mojitonft/mojito-mixers": "file:../mojito-mixers"

Also, make sure you install the following dependencies:

    react
    react-dom
    @mui/material

And also, keep in mind:

- `@emotion/react` is not needed.

- `@emotion/styled` is needed as stated in [MUI's docs](https://mui.com/guides/interoperability/):

    > Keep `@emotion/styled` as a dependency of your project. Even if you never use it explicitly, it's a peer dependency of `@mui/material`.

- `styled-components` is needed as stated in [`react-payment-inputs`' docs](https://github.com/medipass/react-payment-inputs#using-the-built-in-styled-wrapper), but it's not used:

    > Note: <PaymentInputsWrapper> requires styled-components to be installed as a dependency.
    >
    > By default, React Payment Inputs does not have built-in styling for it's inputs. However, React Payment Inputs comes with a styled wrapper which combines the card number, expiry & CVC fields...

<br />


## Usage:

Fist, you need to create a `CheckoutComponent: React.FC<PUICheckoutProps>` component that renders `MojitoCheckout`
and passes it all required props. Simply copy the following file and adapt it to your needs:

You can find an example here: [app/src/layout/CheckoutLayout.tsx](./app/src/layout/CheckoutLayout.tsx).

You'll use this `CheckoutComponent` component in your code instead of `MojitoCheckout` just so that you don't have to
repeat properties that rarely change, like the theme.


```
import { useAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-react';
import { MojitoCheckout } from '@mojitonft/mojito-mixers';


  const { isAuthenticated, getIdTokenClaims } = useAuth0();

  const getAuthenticationToken = useCallback(async () => {
    const token = await getIdTokenClaims();
    return token?.__raw || '';
  }, [getIdTokenClaims]);

  const handleClickGoToMarketPlace = useCallback(async () => {
  }, []);

    <MojitoCheckout
      checkoutOptions={{
        orgId: 'd086ea16-d40d-454c-84a4-64b5e940670a',
        lotId: '17cd1000-323d-4a20-8e5f-7a8598ffae2a',
        quantity: 1,
        paymentId,
        collectionItemId: '64e99437-ac2e-45bc-b4a6-4750985b4e81',
        discountCode: 'ZZTO',
      }}
      uiConfiguration={
        billing: {
          isEnableExpressCheckout: true,
          gpay: true,
          applepay: true,
          walletConnect: true,
          metaMask: true,
        },
        payment: {
          creditCard: true,
          gpay: true,
          applepay: true,
          walletConnect: true,
          wire: true,
        },
        costBreakdown: {
          showDiscountCode: true
        },
        paymentConfirmation: {
          onGoToMarketPlace: handleClickGoToMarketPlace,
        },
      }
      show={ show }
      getAuthenticationToken={ getAuthenticationToken } />
  );
```
<br />

 
### Address Validation & Tax Calculation with Vertex or TaxJar

If you'd like address to be validated and taxes to be calculated during the checkout process, particularly in the Billing
Information step, you need a Vertex or TaxJar account. Once you have it, you need to configure it in Mojito Mint.

Alternatively, set the following prop to disable those calls to the backend: `vertexEnabled = false`.

### Supported Countries

We use Circle for payments, so the supported countries depend on which payment method is going to be used, as described here:

- https://developers.circle.com/docs/supported-countries

<br />
  


### (Secret) Debug Mode

If you quickly click the logo in the top-right corner 16 times, the debug mode will be enabled (toggled, actually), even in production and regardless of
the initial value you passed for the `debug` prop.

The debug mode will, among logging/displaying some other less relevant pieces of data:

<br />


- Show form values and errors as JSON below the form:

  ![Debug form console](./screenshots/debug-console.png)

  ![Debug form values and errors](./screenshots/debug-form-values.png)

<br />


- Show additional logging information for the most relevant queries/mutation being made:

  ![Debug GraphQL queries/mutations log](./screenshots/graphql-logs.png)

<br />


You can see an example here: [`app/src/lib/domain/mui/mui.d.ts`](https://github.com/mojitoinc/mojito-mixers/blob/main/app/src/lib/domain/mui/mui.d.ts)
