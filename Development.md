While this project will be installed as a dependency in other apps, it also provides a development/test playground to speed up development and improve DX. In order to use it:

1. First, duplicate [`app/.env`](https://github.com/mojitoinc/mojito-mixers/blob/main/app/.env) to [`app/.env.local`](https://github.com/mojitoinc/mojito-mixers/blob/main/app/.env.local) and add the two missing values.

2. To start the Next.js development playground:

    ```bash
    yarn --cwd app install
    yarn dev
    ```

    This will install the dependencies defined in [`app/package.json`](https://github.com/mojitoinc/mojito-mixers/blob/main/app/package.json) and run the Next.js app inside `./app`.
    
3. Access the project at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4.  Before committing, be sure to fix all linting errors:

    ```bash
    yarn lint:fix
    ```

### API parameter invalid error:

`createPayment` mutation returns:

    "message": "Circle API return non 200 response with body: {\"code\":2,\"message\":\"API parameter invalid\"}",

Make sure:

- You have a 3DS account configured on the backend for the environment you are using (contact support).

- If you are using a GraphQL playground to play around with the API, make sure you use `https://api-dev.mojito.xyz/`.

- If you are triggering the mutation from your app in localhost, make sure you add the header `"origin-overwrite": "https://yourdomain.com"`.
